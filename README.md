# Circular Motion Simulator

This was written in 2019 and was my first large Java project. It is a simulator that was originally designed as a learning tool for visualising how changing different properties of an object affect its motion when it is travelling in a circle. The goal of the visualisation is to hopefully allow the user to improve their understanding of circular motion. Before creating this repository, I only made minor changes to the source code to tidy it up, but a very large majority of it is unchanged from when it was first written.

### Build and Run
---
First, clone the repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/cg-2611/circular-motion-simulator.git
```
Next, open the directory created by the `git clone` command:
```
cd circular-motion-simulator
```
Once in the project root directory, if gradle is installed run:
```
gradle run
```
Otherwise, the gradle wrapper can be used, on mac/linux run:
```
./gradlew run
```
and on windows run:
```
gradlew.bat run
```
